## Who Am I?

Hey there! I'm **Joaquin Iglesias** — by day, I'm a **Senior Content Engineer I** at **Hack The Box**, where I craft immersive cybersecurity challenges and educational content.

I also volunteer as **CTF Lead** for **Infosec Battle Bots** and **BSides Newcastle**, organizing and building the main CTF events.

When I’m not hacking or building labs, you’ll find me:
- 👨‍🍳 Cooking new recipes  
- 🎶 Vibing to dark melodic music  
- ☕ Sipping coffee or energy drinks  
- 🐱 Hanging with my cats  
- 🏎️ Geeking out over drift cars  
- 🍞 Baking or crafting the perfect pizza dough or croissaints...croisings?.....YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN!!!
